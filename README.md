# Moving-Object-Detection
This project focuses on detecting moving objects in video streams or image sequences. It leverages computer vision techniques to identify and track objects in motion, making it suitable for applications such as surveillance, traffic monitoring, and activity recognition.
# Features
# Object Detection: 
Identifies objects in motion within video or image frames.
# Real-Time Processing: 
Processes video streams for real-time detection (if applicable).
# Customizable Parameters: 
Allows adjustments for sensitivity, frame rate, and object sizes.
# Visualization: 
Highlights detected objects in output frames for better interpretation.

# Project Workflow
# Preprocessing: 
Load video or image sequences and preprocess frames for analysis.
# Background Subtraction: 
Use techniques like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) or frame differencing to identify changes in the scene.
# Object Identification: 
Apply contour detection to isolate moving objects.
# Tracking: 
Implement optional tracking for consistent identification across frames.

# Results
Moving objects are highlighted in the output frames.
Detected objects are tracked across multiple frames for better visualization.

# Applications
Video surveillance
Traffic monitoring
Human activity recognition
Sports analysis

# Future Enhancements
Integration with deep learning models for enhanced detection accuracy.
Optimization for processing high-resolution videos.
Addition of object classification and prediction capabilities.
